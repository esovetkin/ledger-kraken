* Placement of orders method

  change order table in editor (where one can give either percentage
  of assets (hmm) or volumes).

  Run script to compare the current table with a table on kraken and
  change the differences.

* Command-line tool configuration:

  location of ledger-file
  location of keys
  directory for the data files

  ? import configparser

  make account names as configuration

  an interface similar to ledger. so that one can call

  ledger

  and then specify commands in an appeared command line

  or ledger <command> to get output directly

* convertion to ledger: make entries in EUR with precision up to a
  second digit. It would be good if can be done by means of ledger

* a better unifying way to output order book (depth), orders, balance

* Kraken class: read coutner values from a file. Share the counter
  values between different processes?

* db question: how fast is INSERT OR REPLACE. Do I need to create
  extra indices. Do I need to insert in a better way, in case I only
  what fields might change.

* interface to write logs

* parallel query to kraken server?

* parallel query to kraken server?

* log-depth. A better handling path. Now it is relative. Database/key
  cannot be read if it is an absolulte path.

* log-depth: add lock for the script, so that there are no two
  instances trying to fetch data.
