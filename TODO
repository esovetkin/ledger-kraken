* Placement of orders method

  change order table in editor (where one can give either percentage
  of assets (hmm) or volumes).

  Run script to compare the current table with a table on kraken and
  change the differences.

* Command-line tool configuration:

  location of ledger-file
  location of keys
  directory for the data files

  ? import configparser

  make account names as configuration

* make entries in EUR with precision up to a second digit. It would be
  good if can be done by means of ledger

* A simple idea of trading with a spread being large enough to trade.

  Put orders with the same distribution as the current orders.

  One has to introduce the stoppers, in case price drops/rises.

* Collection or historical data: order book with some high values of
  volume inside, trades history

  All these data should be stored in a nice database in order to store
  it efficiently.

* a better unifying way to output order book (depth), orders, balance

* an interface similar to ledger. so that one can call

  ledger

  and then specify commands in an appeared command line

  or ledger <command> to get output directly
