* Placement of orders method

  change order table in editor (where one can give either percentage
  of assets (hmm) or volumes).

  Run script to compare the current table with a table on kraken and
  change the differences.

* convertion to ledger: make entries in EUR with precision up to a
  second digit. It would be good if can be done by means of ledger

  cica's done most of possible, I think

* log rotate, check

  https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html

* logging:

  better handling both file and stdout, see

  https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html

* db question: how fast is INSERT OR REPLACE. Do I need to create
  extra indices. Do I need to insert in a better way, in case I only
  what fields might change.

* timeout problem on queries, have a look in
  kraken.com/help/api. Maybe I can play around with some connection
  parameters.

* function to query times of the avaiable logs. There were some
  interuptions, so we need to get precise time, when logs were
  made. This will give us clear orderBook data.

  This can be done with time_l of orderBook. I checked, it works as
  suppose. I'll write function later

* function to get orderBook + price change in SVM friendly
  format. I'll run SVM to run on cluster. The SVM friendly means:

  (a,b,p), where a,b \in R^d are vectors of asks and bids and given
  fixed steps away from the market price and p is the current market
  price.

* models to try and compare: SVM classifier, SVM regression, random
  forest, neural networks, basic logistic regression
