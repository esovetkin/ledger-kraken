* Placement of orders method

  change order table in editor (where one can give either percentage
  of assets (hmm) or volumes).

  Run script to compare the current table with a table on kraken and
  change the differences.

* convertion to ledger: make entries in EUR with precision up to a
  second digit. It would be good if can be done by means of ledger

  cica's done most of possible, I think

* db question: how fast is INSERT OR REPLACE. Do I need to create
  extra indices. Do I need to insert in a better way, in case I only
  what fields might change.

* timeout problem on queries, have a look in
  kraken.com/help/api. Maybe I can play around with some connection
  parameters.
