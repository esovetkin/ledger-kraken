* Placement of orders method

  change order table in editor (where one can give either percentage
  of assets (hmm) or volumes).

  Run script to compare the current table with a table on kraken and
  change the differences.

* convertion to ledger: make entries in EUR with precision up to a
  second digit. It would be good if can be done by means of ledger

  cica's done most of possible, I think

* log rotate, check

* logging:

  better handling both file and stdout, see

  https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html

* db question: how fast is INSERT OR REPLACE. Do I need to create
  extra indices. Do I need to insert in a better way, in case I only
  what fields might change.

* timeout problem on queries, have a look in
  kraken.com/help/api. Maybe I can play around with some connection
  parameters.

* models to try and compare: SVM classifier, SVM regression, random
  forest, neural networks, basic logistic regression

* figure out what needs to be done to support something more advanced
  than sqlite. All queries to insert/select/create data should work on
  any database. One just need to figure out how to allow to use
  several database API.

  MariaDB should be faster for recalculating indices on insert, etc,
  than sqlite
