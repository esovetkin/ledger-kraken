    # set tier, for proper timeouts before calls:
    # Every user of our API has a "call counter" which starts at 0.

    # Ledger/trade history calls increase the counter by 2.

    # Place/cancel order calls do not affect the counter.

    # All other API calls increase the counter by 1.

    # Tier 2 users have a maximum of 15 and their count gets reduced by 1
    # every 3 seconds. Tier 3 and 4 users have a maximum of 20; the count
    # is reduced by 1 every 2 seconds for tier 3 users, and is reduced by
    # 1 every 1 second for tier 4 users.
    #tier=3
